<!-- 	<div class="row"> -->
		<!-- === Display extra large with one block which take the space of 12 columns ( xl is only used when the size is larger than 1200px). === -->
		<!-- <div class="col-xl-12"></div> -->
		

		<!-- === The blocks now take the whole space which is divided into two parts === -->
		<!-- <div class="col-xl-6"></div>
		<div class="col-xl-6"></div> -->

		<!-- === Block col-xl-6 takes half of the page, two other blocks divide the other half of the page (col-xl-4 take the place of 4 columns and col-xl-2 takes up only 2 columns) === -->
		<!-- <div class="col-xl-6"></div>
		<div class="col-xl-4"></div>
		<div class="col-xl-2"></div> -->


		<!-- === This block will take only 4 columns instead of 6, and we’ll do the same with the second and third blocks. Now the blocks will take up 4 columns when the size is from lg to xl.=== -->
		<!-- <div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-4"></div>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-4"></div>
		<div class="col-xl-2 col-lg-4"></div> -->


		<!-- === I've added col-3,then col-3 for the second one, and col-6 for the third one and because I haven’t specified the display size (neither xl or md), it means that we have xs by default. And this applies for extra-small and going up (from the lesser display to the greater one). This means, starting with xs up to lg (up to large displays) – the grid will consist of 3 columns. So this way we can change the size to the smallest and have 3-3-6. As soon as I cross the line of lg, which is 992px, the grid becomes 4-4-4. But if I go to extra-large, which is more than 1200px, I get 6-4-2.=== -->

		<!-- === If we want to create another row, we just need to create another class “row” rightnext to the first one.

			I.e. if the size is larger than 1200px - everything works fine, but as soon as the size gets less than 1200px – all our blocks are placed one below the other, which doesn’t look really nice.
			The thing is, we wrote col-xl-6 and xl is only used when the size is larger than 1200px. (I.e. the whole space will be equally divided by them.)=== -->

	<!-- ===== Bootstrap: container and container-fluid practice.

	Below I have div with class “row” (the wrapper), and inside of it we have 4 blocks,each block takes up 3 columns.

	In the browser it looks like the following: the first block, the second block, the third block and the fourth block – all of them take up an equal space horizontally. But if you look at the bottom of the browser window, you can see a small horizontal scroll. This is because we used class “row” which, when used on its own, can allow the page to go beyond the screen. 

	So, in order to avoid that - we need to use either a “container-fluid” or a “container” class.

	Let’s use “container-fluid” and see what happens. I create “container-fluid” class,close it after class “row”, and I tabulate class “row” (because it is placed inside).

	If I save and refresh the page I can see, the horizontal scroll disappeared and the blocks fit perfectly within the width of the browser.

	If I reduce or increase the width of the browser – regardless of the actual size of the window – the blocks will be displayed at full browser width.

	 ===== -->

<!-- 	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
		</div>
	</div> -->


	<!-- ===== Now let’s change “container-fluid” to just “container” and if I refresh the page I can see the container is placed in the center and has a certain fixed width (because if we decrease or increase the width of the window, the size of the container stays the same).

	And, accordingly, there are empty spaces on the right and left sides of the screen. To keep track of the browser size. If I open the inspector (inspect page) at the moment the width of the browser is equal to 1291 pixels. 1291 pixels is larger than 1200px. Therefore, it is xl format. 

	And that’s why right now the green block has the fixed width of 1140px.

	We are changing the width of the browser’s screen, but still the green block has the fixed width equal to 1140 pixels.

	Now let’s decrease the width of the screen to lg format.

	For lg format the width of the browser is larger than 992px and less than 1200px.

	We are changing the width.

	Ok, it’s less than 1200px, so it is already lg format and that’s why right now our green block has the fixed width equal to 960px.

	Now the width of the screen is less than 992px, so it is already md format and the green block has the fixed width of 720px.

	Let’s reduce the width even more.

	Ok, the width of the browser is less than 768px, that means it is already sm format.

	Therefore, our green block has the fixed width equal to 540 pixels.

	Now if we cross the line of 576px, it is already xs format and the width of the green block becomes 100% and it acts like “container-fluid”.

	In other words, it is spanned across the whole width of the browser. ===== -->
<!-- 	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
			<div class="col-3"></div>
		</div>
	</div> -->

	

	<!-- ===== Bootstrap - column wrapping =====-->
	<!-- ===== Now let’s write the following classes for each of these blocks: “col-md-4” for the first one, “col-md-4” for the second one, but let’s write, for example, “col-md-6” for the last one. 

	Our overall width of md displays will be 4 plus 4 plus 6 equals 14. 

	Let’s save it and refresh the page. 

	We have a large screen, so everything works according to the rule of the lg format: 4 plus 4 plus 4 equals 12, everything’s fine. 
	Now let’s reduce the size of the window. 

	Here we’ve got lg, and now we have md. Now the third block is moved to the next row and the space left right here is simply empty. 

	This is how column wrapping works. =====-->
<!-- 	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4"></div>
		</div>
	</div> -->




	<!-- ===== Bootstrap - offset =====-->
	<!-- Let’s say I want this block to start from the fourth column instead of the first one, so that there are 3 empty columns before the block. How do we do it? 

	Well, in this case, we need to use the offset-classes.

	Let’s add the class “offset-lg-3” to our block. Now our block is moved over to the right 3 columns.

	In other words, the class “offset-lg-3” says to Bootstrap: “Please, move the div to the right, 3 columns over. -->
<!-- 	<div class="container">
		<div class="row"> -->
<!-- 			<div class="col-lg-4 offset-2"></div> -->

				<!-- Let’s say I want to place this block at the center of the container, so the spaces to the left and to the right of it are equal. What do I need to do? 

				First of all, the overall width of our “row” is 12. So we deduct the width of the block from 12, 12 minus 4 is 8 and our element will be centered if the spaces to the right and to the left are equal. The overall space is 8, so that means 4 to the left and 4 to the right.
				So I need to move the item to the right over by 4 columns. 

				In this case, our item is placed exactly in the center under all sizes for which this rule is written. -->
<!-- 			<div class="col-lg-4 offset-4"></div>
